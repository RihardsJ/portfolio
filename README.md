# My Portfolio webpage
This project is a part of pre-requisites for Founders and Coders bootcamp. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate my current knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Requirements
As the project is a website, the only requirement to view the page is to have a web browser installed on your device. The project has been done using Mozilla Firefox browser. Therefore, for compatibility reasons it is highly recommended to view the page using the Firefox browser. The page also has been tested and worked well on other popular browsers Internet Explorer, Safari and Chrome with an exception of music button icon and e-mail link icon. The compatibility of the code has not been tested on another browsers therefore there is a possibility that some parts of the code will not behave as expected and the user may experience some minor issues.

## Built With

- Main code editor – visual studio code;

- CSS Design – Mozilla Firefox dev tools;
- JavaScript development - Mozilla Firefox dev tools;
- JavaScript debugging – NodeJS;
- Deployment – GitHub Desktop;
- Colour design – [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create);

## Dev Notes
Die Hard image was developed to highlight how can I use CSS and JavaScript to create image filter, animate image and manipulate text.

Laptop with images was inserted to demonstrate my knowledge of forms and how to manipulate them using JavaScript code.

Images in the carousel were inserted through JavaScript in order to gain more control over the image replacement. Adding, removing or changing images can be done by simply changing array values at the beginning of the carousel code in the carousel.js file. The approach also allows to reduce code in the index.html for improved code readability.

CSS media queries and other font size related code was separated in text-font.css to fragment the code and improve code readability and control.

## Design Notes
Carousel flip animation idea emerged during the development of image change function. As it was developed using css display attributes it was considered to animate the movement using either opacity or rotation for better animation. Rotate movement add additional challenge which was interesting to solve.

## Keyboard Navigation
### Navigation menu
**[M]** - opens and closes navigation menu;

### Sound
**[S]** – starts/stops background music;

### Image carousel
