         <h2>Dear Founders and Coders!</h2>
        <article class="letter">
         <p>
            First of all, I would like to thank Gregor and Yvonne as well as the rest of the team for the great month that I have had so far. It is an absolute pleasure to do pair programming. Just to be accepted for pre-course is already exciting thing that I was waiting for many years to happen. 
         </p>
         <p>
            I am amazed by the idea of Founders and Coders and I believe as a bootcamp it really stands out in comparison to others. While most of the bootcamps representing an idea of having a quick course with a job at the end Founders and Coders are highly focused on learning and development. The learning process is highly emphasized and that is what I am looking for. If I am ready to take a job in web development one day that`s great. However, at the moment I am to building skills and knowledge in the field. Therefore, I believe FAC is the best place to continue my learning. The sweetest part is to have a chance to teach others once I have learned my-self.   
         </p>
         <q>
            “Those who know, do. Those that understand, teach.” <br>
            ― Aristotle
         </q>
                <p>
                    I enjoy teaching and guiding others and as Aristotle mentioned it is also a tool to gain deeper understanding about any subject. Not to mention that Codewars are fun to do together and I am planning to reach kyu1 one day.  
                    I am extremely motivated to join Summer cohort and I believe it will be a great journey.   
                    I am looking forward for the interview!
