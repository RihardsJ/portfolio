        <h2>myStory</h2> 
        <p>
            Back in 2008 I have “Riga State Technical School” as a programming engineer. However, as you remember banks messed up something and it was not the best time to look for a job. I decided to take pack my bags and fly to UK to visit my aunty and look for opportunities. Somerset is not a Silicon Valley and my English was far from being perfect so I ended up working in a restaurant just to cover my expenses. 
            For few years I was enjoying afternoon teas and Sunday roasts but somehow, I was not happy with what I was doing. One day I decided to hit the road again and look for better opportunities in the capital. I missed calculated my expenses and ended up spending all my money for the rent. To be sure that I have food in my fridge I started to work in bars (apparently, I am making great espresso martinis &#9786). 
            Martinis are cool but still my childhood dream is living in me. I started to do some C++ coding lessons online just to remember good old days and few month ago I bought a laptop and used my old-warrior to install Linux just to remember how it works. Online lessons are great but I feel that I need some guidance and mentoring to further develop my-self. Unfortunately, the virus arrived and most of things has stopped all over but this time I will not change my direction &#128170.

        <!--fun fact about Rihards name-->
        <p>
            Most probably you wonder how to pronounce my name. Well let me help you with that. <br>
            Do you remember this guy:

            <img src="images/die-hard.jpg" alt="bruce willis">

            Exactly! Ri{Hard}!

        <div>

        <p class="hard">Work hard | Play hard</p>
        <strong>Ri Hard</strong>
        </div>

        <p>
            Apparently, the name is French-Latvian origin and its variations are found all over the world. If you want to know some more facts about it just hit her <a href="https://www.thenamemeaning.com/rihards/" alt="link to rihards name meaning" target="_blank">thenamemeaning.com</a>.

         <p>
            First of all, I would like to thank Gregor and Yvonne as well as the rest of the Founders and Coders team for the great month that I have had so far. It is an absolute pleasure to do pair programming. Just to be accepted for pre-course is already exciting thing that I was waiting for many years to happen. 
         </p>
         <p>
            I like the idea of Founders and Coders and I believe as a bootcamp it really stands out in comparison to others. While most of the bootcamps representing an idea of having a quick course with a job at the end Founders and Coders are highly focused on learning and development. The learning process is highly emphasized and that is what I am looking for. If I am ready to take a job in web development one day that`s great. However, at the moment I am to building skills and knowledge in the field. Therefore, I believe FAC is the best place to continue my learning.  The sweetest part is to have a chance to teach others once I have learned my-self.

         </q>
            <p>
                I enjoy teaching and guiding others and as Aristotle mentioned it is also a tool to gain deeper understanding about any subject. Not to mention that Codewars are fun to do together and I want to reach kyu1 one day.

                    It is an awesome opportunity to be connected with like-minded people and pursue the same dream. I am extremely motivated to start Summer cohort and I believe it will be a great journey.   
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am looking forward for the interview!
