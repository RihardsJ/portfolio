        <!--fun fact about Rihards name-->
        <p>
            Most probably you wonder how to pronounce my name. Well let me help you with that. <br>
            Do you remember this guy:  
        </p>
            <img src="images/die-hard.jpg" alt="bruce willis">
        <p>
            Exactly! Ri{Hard}! 
        </p>

        <div>
        <h2>My Name is also easy to remember</h2>
        <p class="hard">Work hard | Play hard</p>
        <strong>Ri Hard</strong>
        </div>

        <p>
            Apparently, the name is French-Latvian origin and its variations are found all over the world. If you want to know some more facts about it just hit her <a href="https://www.thenamemeaning.com/rihards/" alt="link to rihards name meaning" target="_blank">thenamemeaning.com</a>.

         <p>
            First of all, I would like to thank Gregor and Yvonne as well as the rest of the Founders and Coders team for the great month that I have had so far. It is an absolute pleasure to do pair programming. Just to be accepted for pre-course is already exciting thing that I was waiting for many years to happen. 
         </p>
         <p>
            I like the idea of Founders and Coders and I believe as a bootcamp it really stands out in comparison to others. While most of the bootcamps representing an idea of having a quick course with a job at the end Founders and Coders are highly focused on learning and development. The learning process is highly emphasized and that is what I am looking for. If I am ready to take a job in web development one day that`s great. However, at the moment I am to building skills and knowledge in the field. Therefore, I believe FAC is the best place to continue my learning.  The sweetest part is to have a chance to teach others once I have learned my-self.   
         </p>

            ― Aristotle
         </q>
            <p>
                I enjoy teaching and guiding others and as Aristotle mentioned it is also a tool to gain deeper understanding about any subject. Not to mention that Codewars are fun to do together and I want to reach kyu1 one day.

                    It is an awesome opportunity to be connected with like-minded people and pursue the same dream. I am extremely motivated to start Summer cohort and I believe it will be a great journey.   
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am looking forward for the interview!
